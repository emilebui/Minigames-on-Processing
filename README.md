## Few minigames I made in Processing include:
 - Piano Tiles
 - Shooting fireworks
 - Flying space ship
 - Scuffed Rhythm game
 
## How to run
 - If you don't have Processing, install it at https://processing.org/
 - Just open the games (.pde files) in Processing and press Run
 - Make sure you read the readme file to know how to play first before playing. Enjoy!!
 
## Features:
 - Particle system
 - Kinematics animation: Animation that simulates real-life physics (like gravity, force, ...)
 - Hierarchical model: Complex object made up of multiple parts. Each part can be animated indiviually
 - Viewing pipeline: Using different coordinates for objects, world and then view. (From object coords --> world --> view)
